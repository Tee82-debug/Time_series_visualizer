# **Time Series Data Visualizer**

This project visualizes time series data using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The dataset used contains daily page views of the freeCodeCamp.org forum from **May 9, 2016, to December 3, 2019**. The visualizations help analyze trends and patterns in the forum's traffic data.

## **Project Overview**

The project generates the following visualizations:

1. **Line Chart:** Visualizes the daily page views over the given time period.
2. **Bar Chart:** Shows the average daily page views for each month, grouped by year.
3. **Box Plots:** Presents the distribution of page views:
   - Year-wise Box Plot to show trends over time.
   - Month-wise Box Plot to show seasonality patterns.

## **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Clone or Download the Project**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/time_series_visualizer.git
cd time_series_visualizer
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
Ensure that Python is installed. Use the following command to install the required libraries if they aren't installed yet:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

### **3. Dataset**
The project uses a dataset in CSV format (`fcc-forum-pageviews.csv`) with the following structure:

- **Date:** The date of the forum activity (e.g., 2016-05-09)
- **Value:** The number of page views

Ensure that the dataset is placed in the same directory as your Python scripts.

## **Running the Project**

### **1. Running Visualizations**

To run the visualizations, you can execute `main.py`, which calls each of the plotting functions (`line_plot`, `bar_plot`, and `box_plot`) and displays the charts.

```bash
python main.py
```

### **2. Visualization Functions**

- **Line Plot:** Run this to visualize daily page views.
```python
from time_series_visualizer import line_plot
line_plot()
```

- **Bar Plot:** Run this to generate the average monthly page views grouped by year.
```python
from time_series_visualizer import bar_plot
bar_plot()
```

- **Box Plots:** Run this to visualize the distribution of the data across years and months.
```python
from time_series_visualizer import box_plot
box_plot()
```

### **3. Output Files**
The following files will be generated in the project folder after running the scripts:

- `line_plot.png`
- `bar_plot.png`
- `box_plot.png`

## **Key Functions**

### `clean_data()`
- Loads the dataset and filters out the top and bottom 2.5% of the data to remove outliers.

### `line_plot()`
- Draws a line plot visualizing the daily page views from May 2016 to December 2019.

### `bar_plot()`
- Draws a bar plot showing the average daily page views for each month, grouped by year.

### `box_plot()`
- Draws two box plots:
  - Year-wise Box Plot: Shows the trend of page views for each year.
  - Month-wise Box Plot: Shows the seasonality of page views by month.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib:** For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn:** For enhanced statistical data visualization.

## **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how to visualize time series data using Python and how to identify trends and patterns in web traffic data using line charts, bar charts, and box plots.
